The project appears to be a Turtle Race Simulation built using Python's turtle module. Here's a brief overview:

# Project Overview
- *The script simulates a race between multiple turtles, where each turtle moves a random distance until one crosses the finish line.*
- *The number of racers (between 2 and 10) is determined by user input.*</br>
- *Each turtle is assigned a unique color from a predefined list.*</br>
- *The race progresses with each turtle moving forward by a random distance in each iteration.*</br>
- *The first turtle to reach the top of the screen is declared the winner.*</br>
## Key Features
- *Uses turtle graphics for visualization.*</br>
- *Allows the user to select the number of racers dynamically.*</br>
- *Implements a simple random movement mechanic to simulate racing.*</br>
- *Displays the winner at the end of the race.*</br>
